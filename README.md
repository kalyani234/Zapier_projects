# AI Automation Systems for Medical Aesthetics Clinics
This repository showcases two end-to-end automation systems built for medical aesthetic clinics using Zapier, OpenAI, Google Sheets, HubSpot, and Gmail. These automations reduce manual workload, increase response speed, eliminate inventory errors, and provide real operational impact for clinics offering Botox, fillers, skin treatments, and advanced injectable services.

## Project 1 — AI Lead Qualification System
This system automatically analyses incoming leads and transforms them into structured CRM-ready data. Using Zapier and OpenAI, every inquiry is processed to extract the primary treatment of interest, urgency, budget, concerns, and generate a personalised reply message. HubSpot is updated automatically with AI-enriched fields, enabling the clinic team to prioritise and respond intelligently to high-intent leads.

## Project 2 — Intelligent Inventory Automation
This automation manages stock levels for injectables (Botox, Profhilo, Juvederm, etc.) by updating inventory based on practitioner usage submissions. It detects low-stock conditions and nearing-expiry products, sending Gmail alerts to prevent operational disruptions and financial losses. The workflow ensures real-time inventory accuracy and compliance, eliminating manual tracking errors in medical aesthetics operations.
